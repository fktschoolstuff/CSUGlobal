Initialize an ArrayList 'days' with the days of the week.
Initialize an ArrayList 'temperatures' with null values of the same size as 'days'.
Initialize a Scanner to read user input.

Start an infinite loop.
    Display a menu with options to enter temperature, show temperature, show all temperatures and weekly average, and exit.
    Read user's choice.

    If the choice is "1":
        Prompt the user to enter a day.
        If the entered day is valid:
            Prompt the user to enter the average temperature for that day.
            Update the corresponding temperature in the 'temperatures' ArrayList.
        Else, display an error message.

    If the choice is "2":
        Prompt the user to enter a day.
        If the entered day is valid:
            If the temperature for that day has been entered:
                Display the temperature.
            Else, display a message indicating that the temperature has not been entered yet.
        Else, display an error message.

    If the choice is "Week":
        Initialize a total temperature counter and a count of entered temperatures.
        For each day of the week:
            If the temperature for that day has been entered:
                Display the temperature.
                Add the temperature to the total temperature counter.
                Increment the count of entered temperatures.
            Else, display a message indicating that no data is available for that day.

        If any temperatures have been entered:
            Calculate the weekly average temperature and display it.
        Else, display a message indicating that no temperature data is available to calculate the weekly average.

    If the choice is "Exit":
        Display a message indicating that the program is exiting.
        Break the loop.
    If the choice is anything else, display an error message.

Close the Scanner.
